He then earned his PsyD in Clinical Psychology from the Wright Institute in Berkeley, CA. His undergraduate thesis proposed a theoretical extension of research on racism as a chronic stressor, and its subsequent impact on physical and psychological wellbeing, to understand transphobia as chronic stress. Dr. Bailey’s dissertation explored the importance of the therapeutic alliance and the treatment frame when working with patients experiencing psychosis. Throughout his training he specialized in providing individual and group psychodynamic psychotherapy to adults diagnosed with personality and dissociative disorders, with a particular interest in Borderline Personality Disorder and Dissociative Identity Disorder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</>\n\t);\n}","import Header from \"../components/Header\";\n\nexport default function Clinical() {\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t<>\n\t\t\t<Header />\n\t\t\t<div className=\"pageContainer\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3>Clinical Services</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>Individual Therapy</h4>\n\t\t\t\t<p style={{ textIndent: '40px' }}>I am currently offering in-person psychotherapy services for adults.

Every treatment serves as a reminder to me that it is a privilege to sit with another and to witness their process of transformation. By connecting with their values and becoming grounded in the present I have seen folks from a variety of diverse backgrounds and identity intersections increase their capacity to feel, understand, and integrate a range of emotional experiences and become curious about themselves and others.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<p style={{ textIndent: '40px' }}>This includes being curious about the therapeutic relationship we will build together.
