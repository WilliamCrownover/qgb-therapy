					<h3>Trans Inclusive Clinic Consultation</h3>
					<p style={{ textIndent: '40px' }}>Providing ethical clinical care means providing trans inclusive services. From the moment of first contact with a clinic or provider to eventual treatment termination, every patient deserves to be seen and understood for their true self. I provide consultation services and trainings on trans inclusive clinical care. This includes reviewing paperwork, documentation, and other clinic practices and trainings on trans inclusive clinical interviews.</p>
					<br />
					<p style={{ textIndent: '40px' }}>As an intern at The Pacific Center for Human Growth, the oldest LGBTQIA+ Center in the Bay Area, I worked closely with administrative staff to overhaul the phone screen and intake process for both efficiency and trans inclusion. This included developing language for clinicians to talk with patients about gender while acknowledging current limitations of documentation requirements within healthcare systems in order to prevent the burden of those limitations from being passed onto the patient.</p>
