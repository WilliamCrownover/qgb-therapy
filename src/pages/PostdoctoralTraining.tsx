			<h4>Position Description</h4>
			<TabbedParagraph content={'QGB Therapy LLC offers a 12-24-month postdoctoral program during which postdoctoral associates will be supported by Dr. Bailey in cultivating essential skills for private practice through supervision and consultation. This postdoctoral program is intentionally designed to deepen understanding of psychoanalytic theory and support integrating theory with culturally humble clinical services. There are three areas of emphasis available (postdoctoral associates may choose more than one area of emphasis):'}/>
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>culturally humble care for personality disorders</li>
				<li>culturally humble care for severe dissociative disorders</li>
				<li>culturally humble care for trans and gender-expansive folks</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<TabbedParagraph content={'This postdoctoral program is flexible and customizable for each postdoctoral associate, encouraging and supporting a sustainable practice for each clinician. Each clinician decides their hours, caseload size, and practice structure (electronic health record, fee/sliding-scale, advertising and referrals, etc.) with guidance from Dr. Bailey. This program offers a competitive fee-split and allows postdoctoral associates to take their full caseload with them once licensed.'}/>
			<br />
			<TabbedParagraph content={'While this postdoctoral program is structured to allow for as little overhead as possible, it is recommended to have an additional source of income during the first few months of the program while building up a caseload. Earnings vary depending on patient and clinician availability. Dr. Bailey actively maintains several referral sources for the postdoctoral program as well as mentoring postdoctoral associates in establishing their own referrals networks.'}/>
			<br />
			<TabbedParagraph content={'Patients are from throughout California from various diverse backgrounds and experiences. All patients are fee for service, and postdoctoral associates are supported in setting their own fee and deciding what percentage of their caseload is sliding scale.'}/>
			<br />
			<TabbedParagraph content={'In addition, Dr. Bailey provides active support throughout the licensure process to encourage postdoctoral associate success. This includes support with the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP), the California Laws and Ethics Exam (CPLEE), and other licensing requirements. Postdoctoral associates have access to Dr. Bailey via phone and email 24/7 and are required to contact them should there be any crisis situations. Postdoctoral associates are required to register as psychological associates and be in good standing with the California Board of Psychology.'}/>
			<br />
			<TabbedParagraph content={'For those interested in learning more about this postdoctoral program, please email Dr. Bailey a copy of your current CV and a cover letter. Positions are available year-round, space permitting. The program is currently open to those seeking a postdoctoral position in California.'}/>
			<br />
			<TabbedParagraph content={'Postdoctoral associates are selected based on a comprehensive review of education, clinical experience, and interpersonal “fit” with QGB Therapy LLC.
